# Deliberate Marketing Plan (Post-Release)

This plan assumes v1.0.3 is already live and focuses on a fast, credible adoption push. The primary success metric for the next 30 days is NPM downloads, with GitHub stars as secondary social proof. We will operate under the Greymata persona on X and post only from the company page on LinkedIn. The voice is “we,” not “I.”

## Positioning

Deliberate is the seatbelt for agentic coding. The core message is that a “human in the loop” is not enough once agents can execute shell commands. The product prevents catastrophic mistakes and creates an automatic safety net before destructive actions are allowed. We will run two angles in parallel: concrete fear stories about repo wipes and data loss, and empowerment framing around workflow-aware safety and automatic backups. Both angles lead to the same CTA: install the tool and get protected immediately.

## Distribution Strategy

The first owned channel will be a landing page at `the-radar.net/tools/deliberate`. Every external post should route to that page or the GitHub README, but the page should become the long-term hub. Its job is to convert attention into installations and a future Cloud waitlist. The rented channels will be X and LinkedIn. X is the primary driver for developer adoption and conversation. LinkedIn is the credibility anchor on a slower cadence, and because persona accounts are risky, all LinkedIn posts will be published from the company page only. Borrowed distribution comes from small, high-trust developer communities and short outreach to devtools writers and security-minded engineers.

## Content Cadence (First 30 Days)

We will run a steady cadence and keep feedback loops short. Week 1 focuses on the core launch narrative and proof of value: publish the GitHub release, ship a short terminal demo GIF, and post one concise thread on X plus one LinkedIn post. The job in Week 1 is to make the tool feel real and useful in under 30 seconds. Weeks 2–3 shift to momentum with two short X updates per week and one longer post that includes a screenshot or short clip. LinkedIn stays at one post per week, strictly from the company page. During this stretch we also collect small user quotes and war stories. Week 4 consolidates with a short “what we learned” post, a usage highlight, and a soft teaser for Cloud with a simple waitlist form.

## Demo Asset

The most important visual is a terminal flow that shows the problem and the save. The arc is simple: an agent tries `rm -rf src`, Deliberate warns and shows what will be lost, a backup path is created, and the user blocks the command. This asset will appear on X, the landing page, and the GitHub release.

## Interview Script (for User Quotes)

Keep the interview short and structured. We are looking for one-paragraph quotes that can be used in posts and on the landing page. Ask what destructive command they last saw, what they wished a safety layer had done, what would make them install Deliberate, and what feels safer or faster after trying it. Target 5–8 interviews; two strong quotes are enough to start.

## Metrics and Reporting

Primary is NPM downloads. Secondary is GitHub stars. We will track weekly deltas and align messaging to the posts that correlate with the biggest download spikes.

## Next Actions

Publish the landing page under `the-radar.net/tools/deliberate` with a simple install CTA and a short waitlist form for Cloud. Record the terminal demo, and post the first X thread and LinkedIn announcement within 48 hours. After that, iterate based on response and tighten the story around the strongest angle.
